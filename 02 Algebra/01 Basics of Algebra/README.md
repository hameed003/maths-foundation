# **Basics of Algebra**

Algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with symbols (variables) and the rules for manipulating these symbols to solve equations and understand relationships between quantities. It generalizes arithmetic by using letters to represent numbers.

For example, if you know that the total cost of 3 apples is $15, but you don’t know the price of one apple, algebra allows you to express it as:

$$
3x = 15
$$

where $x$ is the price of one apple. Solving for $x$ gives $x = 5$.

## **1. Introduction to Variables and Constants**

### **Variables**

Variables are symbols (usually letters like $x, y, a, b$) that represent unknown or changing values.  
**Example:**

- In the equation $x + 5 = 10$, $x$ is a variable representing an unknown number (here, $x = 5$).

$$
x = 10 - 5 = 5
$$

### **Constants**

Constants are fixed values that do not change.  
**Example:**

- In the expression $3x + 7$, the number $7$ is a constant.

In the equation:

$$
y = 2x + 7
$$

- $x$ and $y$ are variables.
- $2$ and $7$ are constants.

## 2. **Algebraic Expressions**

An **algebraic expression** is a combination of variables, constants, and mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

### **Examples of Algebraic Expressions**

1. $x + 3$ (Linear expression)
2. $4x + 3$ (Linear expression)
3. $2x^2 - 5x + 1$ (Quadratic expression)
4. $7y^3 + \frac{2}{y}$ (Polynomial expression)

### **Components of an Algebraic Expression:**

- **Terms:** Parts of an expression separated by \(+\) or \(-\).
  - In $5x^2 + 3x - 2$, the terms are $5x^2$, $3x$, and \(-2\).
- **Coefficients:** Numbers multiplying variables.
  - In $7y$, the coefficient of $y$ is $7$.
- **Degree:** The highest power of the variable.
  - $4x^3 - x + 9$ has a degree of $3$.

### **Types of Algebraic Expressions**

1. **Monomial** – Contains only one term (e.g., $5x, 3y^2$).
2. **Binomial** – Contains two terms (e.g., $x + 5, 3a - 2b$).
3. **Trinomial** – Contains three terms (e.g., $x^2 + 2x + 1$).
4. **Polynomial** – Contains one or more terms (e.g., $x^3 - 4x^2 + 2x - 6$).

## 3. **Basic Algebraic Operations**

### **(a) Addition & Subtraction**

We can only add or subtract **like terms** (terms with the same variable and exponent).  
**Examples:**

1. $3x + 5x = 8x$
2. $7a^2 - 2a^2 = 5a^2$
3. $4x + 2y - x + 3y = 3x + 5y$

### **(b) Multiplication**

Multiply coefficients and add exponents of like variables. OR Multiply each term in one expression by each term in the other.
**Examples:**

1. $3x \times 4x = 12x^2$
2. $2a \times 5b = 10ab$
3. $(x + 2)(x + 3) = x^2 + 3x + 2x + 6 = x^2 + 5x + 6$ (Using the distributive property)

### **(c) Division**

Divide coefficients and subtract exponents.  
**Examples:**

1. $\frac{6x^3}{2x} = 3x^2$

2. $\frac{10a^2b}{5ab} = 2a$

3. $\frac{6x^2 + 9x}{3x} = 2x + 3$

## **Properties of Algebraic Operations**

### **(a) Commutative Property**

- Order of addition or multiplication does not change the result.

- **Addition:** $a + b = b + a$
  - Example: $3 + 5 = 5 + 3$
- **Multiplication:** $a \times b = b \times a$
  - Example: $4 \times 7 = 7 \times 4$
- **Does not apply to subtraction & division:**

  - $5 - 3 \neq 3 - 5$
  - $10 ÷ 2 \neq 2 ÷ 10$

### **(b) Associative Property**

- Grouping of numbers does not affect addition or multiplication.

- **Addition:** $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$
  - Example: $(2 + 3) + 4 = 2 + (3 + 4)$
- **Multiplication:** $(a \times b) \times c = a \times (b \times c)$
  - Example: $(3 \times 4) \times 5 = 3 \times (4 \times 5)$
- **Does not apply to subtraction & division.**

### **(c) Distributive Property**

- Multiplication distributes over addition or subtraction.

- Multiplication over addition: $a(b + c) = ab + ac$
  - Example: $3(x + 4) = 3x + 12$
- Multiplication over subtraction: $a(b - c) = ab - ac$
  - Example: $5(2x - 3) = 10x - 15$
