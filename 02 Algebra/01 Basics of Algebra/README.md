## **Basics of Algebra**

Algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with symbols and the rules for manipulating those symbols. It helps us solve problems where numbers are unknown by representing them with variables.

For example, if you know that the total cost of 3 apples is $15, but you don’t know the price of one apple, algebra allows you to express it as:

$$
3x = 15
$$

where $x$ is the price of one apple. Solving for $x$ gives $x = 5$.

## **Introduction to Variables and Constants**

### **Variables**

- A variable is a symbol (usually a letter) that represents an unknown value.
- It can take different values.
- Examples: $x, y, a, b$

For example, if we say $x + 3 = 10$, the variable $x$ can be solved as:

$$
x = 10 - 3 = 7
$$

### **Constants**

- A constant is a fixed value that does not change.
- Example: The number $5$ in the equation $x + 5 = 10$ is a constant.

In the equation:

$$
y = 2x + 7
$$

- $x$ and $y$ are variables.
- $2$ and $7$ are constants.

## **Algebraic Expressions**

An **algebraic expression** is a combination of variables, constants, and mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

### **Examples of Algebraic Expressions**

1. $x + 3$
2. $2a - 5b$
3. $4x^2 - 7x + 9$

### **Types of Algebraic Expressions**

1. **Monomial** – Contains only one term (e.g., $5x, 3y^2$).
2. **Binomial** – Contains two terms (e.g., $x + 5, 3a - 2b$).
3. **Trinomial** – Contains three terms (e.g., $x^2 + 2x + 1$).
4. **Polynomial** – Contains one or more terms (e.g., $x^3 - 4x^2 + 2x - 6$).

## **Basic Algebraic Operations**

### **1. Addition of Algebraic Expressions**

Add like terms together.  
Example:

$$
(3x + 2y) + (5x - y) = (3x + 5x) + (2y - y) = 8x + y
$$

### **2. Subtraction of Algebraic Expressions**

Subtract like terms.  
Example:

$$
(4x + 7) - (2x + 3) = (4x - 2x) + (7 - 3) = 2x + 4
$$

### **3. Multiplication of Algebraic Expressions**

Multiply each term in one expression by each term in the other.  
Example:

$$
(x + 2)(x + 3) = x^2 + 3x + 2x + 6 = x^2 + 5x + 6
$$

### **4. Division of Algebraic Expressions**

Divide each term separately.  
Example:

$$
\frac{6x^2 + 9x}{3x} = 2x + 3
$$

## **Properties of Algebraic Operations**

### **1. Commutative Property**

- Order of addition or multiplication does not change the result.
- **Addition**: $a + b = b + a$
- **Multiplication**: $a \times b = b \times a$
- Example:
  - $2 + 3 = 3 + 2$
  - $4 \times 5 = 5 \times 4$

### **2. Associative Property**

- Grouping of numbers does not affect addition or multiplication.
- **Addition**: $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$
- **Multiplication**: $(a \times b) \times c = a \times (b \times c)$
- Example:
  - $(2 + 3) + 4 = 2 + (3 + 4) = 9$
  - $(2 \times 3) \times 4 = 2 \times (3 \times 4) = 24$

### **3. Distributive Property**

- Multiplication distributes over addition or subtraction.
- Formula: $a \times (b + c) = a \times b + a \times c$
- Example:
  - $3 \times (4 + 5) = 3 \times 4 + 3 \times 5 = 12 + 15 = 27$
