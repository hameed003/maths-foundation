## **Factors and Multiples Explained in Detail (With Examples)**

### **🔹 What are Factors?**

A **factor** of a number is a number that **divides it exactly** without leaving a remainder.

✅ **Example:** Factors of **12**

- 12 ÷ **1** = **12** ✅

- 12 ÷ **2** = **6** ✅

- 12 ÷ **3** = **4** ✅

- 12 ÷ **4** = **3** ✅

- 12 ÷ **6** = **2** ✅

- 12 ÷ **12** = **1** ✅  
  So, the **factors of 12** are: **1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12**.

📌 **Key Properties of Factors:**  
✔️ Every number has **1 and itself** as factors.  
✔️ **Factors are always smaller than or equal to the number**.  
✔️ **Prime numbers** have only **two factors** (1 and itself).

✅ **Example of Prime and Composite Factors:**

- Factors of **7**: **1, 7** (Prime Number ✅)
- Factors of **18**: **1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18** (Composite Number ✅)

### **🔹 What are Multiples?**

A **multiple** of a number is the result of multiplying it by any whole number.

✅ **Example:** Multiples of **5**

- 5 × **1** = **5** ✅

- 5 × **2** = **10** ✅

- 5 × **3** = **15** ✅

- 5 × **4** = **20** ✅

- 5 × **5** = **25** ✅  
  So, **multiples of 5** are: **5, 10, 15, 20, 25, … (infinite)**

📌 **Key Properties of Multiples:**  
✔️ **Every number has infinite multiples**.  
✔️ **Multiples are always greater than or equal to the number**.

## **Prime Factorization Explained in Detail**

### **What is Prime Factorization?**

Prime factorization is the process of breaking down a number into a product of **prime numbers**.

🔹 **Prime Number:** A number that has only two factors: **1 and itself** (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.).  
🔹 **Composite Number:** A number that has more than two factors (e.g., 4, 6, 8, 12, etc.).

### **How to Perform Prime Factorization?**

There are two main methods:

1. **Division Method**
2. **Factor Tree Method**

---

## **1. Prime Factorization Using the Division Method**

**Steps:**

1. **Divide** the given number by the smallest prime number (2, 3, 5, 7, etc.).
2. **Continue dividing** until the quotient is 1.
3. **Write the prime factors** as a product.

### **Example 1: Prime Factorization of 60**

**Step-by-step process:**

1. 60 ÷ **2** = 30
2. 30 ÷ **2** = 15
3. 15 ÷ **3** = 5
4. 5 is already prime, so we stop here.

📌 **Prime Factorization of 60 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 = 2² × 3 × 5**

---

## **2. Prime Factorization Using the Factor Tree Method**

**Steps:**

1. Write the number and break it into any two factors.
2. If the factors are **not prime**, keep breaking them down.
3. Continue until all factors are prime.
4. Write them as a product.

### **Example 2: Prime Factorization of 48**

```
        48
       /    \
      2      24
           /    \
          2      12
               /    \
              2      6
                   /    \
                  2      3
```

📌 **Prime Factorization of 48 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 = 2⁴ × 3**

---

## **Prime Factorization of Large Numbers**

For large numbers, use the **division method** systematically, testing divisibility by prime numbers like **2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc.**

### **Example 3: Prime Factorization of 180**

1. 180 ÷ **2** = 90
2. 90 ÷ **2** = 45
3. 45 ÷ **3** = 15
4. 15 ÷ **3** = 5
5. 5 is prime.

📌 **Prime Factorization of 180 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 = 2² × 3² × 5**

## **Coprime Numbers (Relatively Prime Numbers) Explained in Detail**

### **What are Coprime Numbers?**

Two numbers are said to be **coprime** (or **relatively prime**) if their **Highest Common Factor (HCF) is 1**. This means they have **no common factors except 1**.

### **Example:**

## **Properties of Coprime Numbers**

1. **Their HCF is always 1**.
2. **Their LCM is their product** (if they are the only two numbers).
3. **Two consecutive numbers are always coprime** (e.g., 5 and 6).
4. **A prime number is coprime with any number that is not a multiple of itself** (e.g., 7 and 10).

## **How to Check If Two Numbers Are Coprime?**

### **Method 1: Find HCF**

If **HCF = 1**, they are coprime.

- **Example:** (9, 28)

  - **14** = **2 × 7**
  - **25** = **5 × 5**
  - **No common prime factors** ✅
  - 📌 **Coprime** ✅
