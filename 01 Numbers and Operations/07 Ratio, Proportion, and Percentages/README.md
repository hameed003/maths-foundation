## **Concept of Ratio ‚Äì Detailed Explanation with Examples**

### **1. Definition of Ratio**

A **ratio** is a mathematical comparison between two or more quantities of the **same kind**, showing how many times one value contains or is contained within another. It expresses the **relative size** of quantities.

- **Representation**:
  - Written using a colon (`:`) ‚Üí e.g., `a:b` (read as "a to b")
  - Can also be written as a fraction (`a/b`) or with the word "to" ("a to b").

üìå **Example:**  
If a class has **10 boys** and **15 girls**, the ratio of boys to girls is:

$$
\text{Ratio} = 10:15 = \frac{10}{15} = \frac{2}{3}
$$

(After simplifying, the ratio is **2:3**)

---

### **2. Key Properties of Ratios**

1. **Same Units**: Ratios compare quantities measured in the **same units** (e.g., kg, liters, or counts).

   - ‚úÖ Correct: Comparing 2 kg apples to 3 kg oranges ‚Üí `2:3`.
   - ‚ùå Incorrect: Comparing 2 km to 3 hours (different units).

2. **No Units**: Ratios themselves **do not have units** (e.g., `2:3` is unitless).

3. **Order Matters**: `a:b` is **not the same** as `b:a`.

   - Example: The ratio of boys to girls (`2:3`) ‚â† girls to boys (`3:2`).

4. **Simplification**: Ratios can be simplified like fractions by dividing all terms by their **greatest common divisor (GCD)**.

   - Example: `4:6` simplifies to `2:3` (divided by 2).

5. **Multiplication or Division**:
   - If we multiply or divide both terms of a ratio by the same number, the ratio remains the same.
   - **Example:** $$4:6$$ ‚Üí Divide by **2** ‚Üí $$2:3$$ (Same ratio)

### **3. Types of Ratios**

| Type              | Description                          | Example                                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Part-to-Part**  | Compares parts within a group.       | In a class, the ratio of boys to girls is `2:3`. |
| **Part-to-Whole** | Compares a part to the entire group. | The ratio of boys to total students is `2:5`.    |
| **Whole-to-Part** | Compares the whole group to a part.  | The ratio of total students to girls is `5:3`.   |

#### **(a) Simple Ratio**

A ratio that directly compares two values.  
üîπ **Example:** The ratio of 4 apples to 6 bananas is **4:6**, which simplifies to **2:3**.

#### **(b) Compound Ratio**

A ratio obtained by multiplying two or more simple ratios.  
üîπ **Example:**

- The ratio of **A:B** is **2:3**,
- The ratio of **B:C** is **4:5**,
- The compound ratio **A:C** is:

$$
(2:3) \times (4:5) = \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{4}{5} = \frac{8}{15} = 8:15
$$

#### **(c) Duplicate Ratio**

The ratio obtained by squaring each term of a given ratio.  
üîπ **Example:** The **duplicate ratio** of **2:3** is:

$$
(2^2 : 3^2) = (4:9)
$$

#### **(d) Inverse Ratio**

The reciprocal of a given ratio.  
üîπ **Example:** The **inverse ratio** of **4:5** is **5:4**.

### **4. Applications of Ratio**

#### **(a) In Daily Life**

- **Cooking Recipe**:Pancake mix requires flour and sugar in a `3:1` ratio.
- If you use **6 cups of flour**, you need **2 cups of sugar** (since `6:2 = 3:1`).

- **Shopping**: Comparing discounts, e.g., "Buy 1 Get 1 Free" is a **1:1** ratio.

#### **(b) In Business & Finance**

- **Debt-to-Income Ratio** If your monthly debt is **$500** and income is **$2,500**, the ratio is `500:2500 = 1:5`.

- **Profit sharing**: If two partners invest in a **3:2** ratio, profits are shared in the same ratio.

- **Interest Rates**: Banks use ratios to calculate loan interest.

#### **(c) In Mathematics**

- Ratios help in **solving proportion problems**.
- **Example:** If 3 pencils cost ‚Çπ15, what is the cost of 5 pencils?

$$
\text{Cost per pencil} = 15 \div 3 = 5 \text{‚Çπ}
$$

$$
\text{Cost of 5 pencils} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{‚Çπ}
$$

#### **(d) Speed (Distance:Time)**:

- A car travels **120 km in 2 hours** ‚Üí Speed ratio = `120:2` = `60:1` (km/h).

#### **(e) Map Scale**:

- A map scale of `1:50,000` means **1 cm on the map = 50,000 cm (0.5 km) in reality**.

### **5. How to Find and Simplify Ratios?**

**Example**: In a basket, there are **8 apples and 12 oranges**.

- **Step 1**: Write the ratio ‚Üí `Apples:Oranges = 8:12`.
- **Step 2**: Simplify by dividing by GCD (here, GCD of 8 & 12 is **4**).
- **Final Ratio**: `8 √∑ 4 : 12 √∑ 4 = 2:3`.

**Interpretation**: For every **2 apples**, there are **3 oranges**.

---

### **6. Equivalent Ratios**

Ratios can be **scaled up or down** while keeping the same proportion.

- Example:
  - `2:3` is equivalent to:
    - `4:6` (multiplied by 2),
    - `6:9` (multiplied by 3),
    - `1:1.5` (divided by 2).

---

### **7. Ratio vs. Fraction**

| Feature           | Ratio                         | Fraction                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Represents**    | Comparison between quantities | Part of a whole                    |
| **Example**       | `2:3` (boys to girls)         | `2/5` (boys out of total students) |
| **Units**         | No units                      | No units                           |
| **Order Matters** | Yes (`2:3 ‚â† 3:2`)             | Yes (`2/5 ‚â† 5/2`)                  |

---

### **8. Common Mistakes to Avoid**

1. **Mixing Units**:

   - ‚ùå Incorrect: Comparing `2 kg` of rice to `3 liters` of milk.
   - ‚úÖ Correct: Compare `2 kg` rice to `3 kg` sugar.

2. **Ignoring Order**:

   - The ratio `3:2` (men:women) is **not the same** as `2:3` (women:men).

3. **Not Simplifying**:
   - A ratio of `10:15` should be simplified to `2:3`.

# **Simplifying Ratios: Explanation with Examples**

## **1. What Does It Mean to Simplify a Ratio?**

Simplifying a ratio means reducing it to its **smallest possible whole-number form** while keeping the **same proportion** between quantities.

**Key Idea**:  
Just like simplifying fractions (e.g., $\frac{4}{8}$ simplifies to $\frac{1}{2}$), ratios can be simplified by dividing all terms by their **greatest common divisor (GCD)**.

üìå **Example:**  
The ratio **18:24** can be simplified as:

$$
\frac{18}{24} = \frac{3}{4} \quad \text{(Dividing both by 6, the GCD of 18 and 24)}
$$

So, **18:24** simplifies to **3:4**.

---

## **2. Steps to Simplify a Ratio**

Follow these steps to simplify a ratio:

**Step 1: Write the Ratio** (e.g., `36:48`).

**Step 2: Find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**

Find the **largest number** that divides both terms of the ratio.

üîπ **Example:** Simplify **36:48**

- Factors of **36** = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36}
- Factors of **48** = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48}
- **GCD = 12**

**Step 3: Divide Both Terms by the GCD**

$$
\frac{36}{12} : \frac{48}{12} = 3:4
$$

\[
\frac{36}{12} : \frac{48}{12} = 3:4
\]

So, **36:48** simplifies to **3:4**.

   - Factors of **18** = {1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18}
   - **GCD of 30, 42, and 18 = 6**

2. Divide all terms by 6:
   $$
   \frac{30}{6} : \frac{42}{6} : \frac{18}{6} = 5:7:3
   $$
   ‚úÖ **Final Answer: 5:7:3**

### **Example 3: Simplifying Ratios with Decimals**

Simplify **`2.5:7.5`**

**Step 1**: Eliminate decimals/fractions by multiplying all terms by the **same number**.

**Step 2**: Find GCD if required.

**Example1**:

Simplify **`2.5:7.5`**

1. Convert to whole numbers by multiplying by **10**:
   $$
   (2.5 \times 10) : (7.5 \times 10) = 25:75
   $$
2. Find GCD (**GCD of 25 and 75 = 25**):
   $$
   \frac{25}{25} : \frac{75}{25} = 1:3
   $$
   ‚úÖ **Final Answer: 1:3**

**Example 2**:

Simplify **`1.5 : 3.5`**.

1. Multiply by 2 ‚Üí $1.5 √ó 2 = 3$, $3.5 √ó 2 = 7$.

2. Multiply both fractions by **24**:
   $$
   \left(\frac{6}{8} \times 24\right) : \left(\frac{9}{12} \times 24\right) = 18:18
   $$
3. Simplify:
   $$
   18:18 = 1:1
   $$
   ‚úÖ **Final Answer: 1:1**
