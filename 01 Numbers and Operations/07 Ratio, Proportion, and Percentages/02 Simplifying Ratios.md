# **Simplifying Ratios: Explanation with Examples**

## **1. What Does It Mean to Simplify a Ratio?**

Simplifying a ratio means reducing it to its **smallest possible whole-number form** while keeping the **same proportion** between quantities.

**Key Idea**:  
Just like simplifying fractions (e.g., $\frac{4}{8}$ simplifies to $\frac{1}{2}$), ratios can be simplified by dividing all terms by their **greatest common divisor (GCD)**.

📌 **Example:**  
The ratio **18:24** can be simplified as:

$$
\frac{18}{24} = \frac{3}{4} \quad \text{(Dividing both by 6, the GCD of 18 and 24)}
$$

So, **18:24** simplifies to **3:4**.

## **2. Steps to Simplify a Ratio**

Follow these steps to simplify a ratio:

**Step 1: Write the Ratio** (e.g., `36:48`).

**Step 2: Find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**

Find the **largest number** that divides both terms of the ratio.

🔹 **Example:** Simplify **36:48**

- Factors of **36** = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36}
- Factors of **48** = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48}
- **GCD = 12**

**Step 3: Divide Both Terms by the GCD**

$$
\frac{36}{12} : \frac{48}{12} = 3:4
$$

So, **36:48** simplifies to **3:4**.

## **3. Examples of Simplifying Ratios**

### **Example 1: Basic Ratio**

Simplify **15:25**

- **GCD of 15 and 25 = 5**

$$
\frac{15}{5} : \frac{25}{5} = 3:5
$$

$$
\frac{15}{5} \colon \frac{25}{5} = 3:5
$$

✅ **Final Answer: 3:5**

### **Example 2: Simplifying Ratios with Units**

**Rule**: Convert quantities to the **same unit** before simplifying.

**Example**:  
Simplify the ratio **2 meters : 50 centimeters**.

1. Convert meters to cm → 2 m = **200 cm**.
2. Ratio becomes `200:50`.
3. GCD of 200 and 50 = **50**.
4. Simplified ratio = `4:1`.

### **Example 2: Simplifying Ratios with More Than Two Terms**

**Same rule**: Divide all terms by their GCD.

**Example**:
Simplify **`30:42:18`**

1. Find the **GCD of 30, 42, and 18**

   - Factors of **30** = {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30}
   - Factors of **42** = {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42}
   - Factors of **18** = {1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18}
   - **GCD of 30, 42, and 18 = 6**

2. Divide all terms by 6:

$$
\frac{30}{6} : \frac{42}{6} : \frac{18}{6} = 5:7:3
$$

✅ **Final Answer: 5:7:3**

### **Example 3: Simplifying Ratios with Decimals**

Simplify **`2.5:7.5`**

**Step 1**: Eliminate decimals/fractions by multiplying all terms by the **same number**.

**Step 2**: Find GCD if required.

**Example1**:

Simplify **`2.5:7.5`**

1. Convert to whole numbers by multiplying by **10**:

$$
(2.5 \times 10) : (7.5 \times 10) = 25:75
$$

2. Find GCD (**GCD of 25 and 75 = 25**):

$$
\frac{25}{25} : \frac{75}{25} = 1:3
$$

✅ **Final Answer: 1:3**

**Example 2**:

Simplify **`1.5 : 3.5`**.

1. Multiply by 2 → $1.5 × 2 = 3$, $3.5 × 2 = 7$.
2. New ratio = `3:7` (already simplified).

### **Example 4: Simplifying Ratios with Fractions**

Simplify **$\frac{6}{8} : \frac{9}{12}$**

1. Convert to whole numbers by finding the **LCM of denominators (8 and 12 = 24)**
2. Multiply both fractions by **24**:

$$
\left(\frac{6}{8} \times 24\right) : \left(\frac{9}{12} \times 24\right) = 18:18
$$

3. Simplify:

$$
 18:18 = 1:1
$$

✅ **Final Answer: 1:1**

### **Example 5: Simplifying Ratios with Mixed Numbers**

**Step 1**: Convert mixed numbers to improper fractions.  
**Step 2**: Follow the fraction simplification method.

**Example**:  
Simplify **`2½ : 1¼`**.

1. Convert to fractions → $\frac{5}{2} : \frac{5}{4}$.
2. Multiply by 4 → $\frac{5}{2} × 4 = 10$, $\frac{5}{4} × 4 = 5$.
3. Simplified ratio = `10:5` → `2:1` (divide by GCD 5).

## **4. Special Cases in Simplifying Ratios**

### **Case 1: When One Term is 1**

A ratio of **1:x** is already in its simplest form.  
🔹 **Example:** **1:7** (Cannot be simplified further)

### **Case 2: When the Terms Are Prime Numbers**

If both numbers are **prime** (no common factors except 1), the ratio is already in its simplest form.  
🔹 **Example:** **7:11** (Cannot be simplified)

## **5. Applications of Simplified Ratios**

- **In Cooking:** If a recipe needs **2:3** flour to sugar, keeping the correct ratio ensures perfect taste.
- **In Maps:** A scale of **1:1000** means **1 cm** on the map equals **1000 cm** in real life.
- **In Finance:** Debt-to-equity ratios help businesses compare financial health.

### **8. Common Mistakes to Avoid**

| Mistake                      | Wrong Simplification        | Correct Simplification |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Not using the same units** | 2 kg : 500 g = `2:500`      | `2000:500` = `4:1`     |
| **Ignoring the GCD**         | `9:12` = `3:6` (❌)         | `9:12` = `3:4` (✅)    |
| **Incorrect order**          | `5:10` simplified as `10:5` | `5:10` = `1:2`         |
