# **Unitary Method â€“ Explanation with Examples**

## **1. What is the Unitary Method?**

The **unitary method** is a mathematical approach used to solve problems by **first finding the value of a single unit (one item)** and then using it to find the value of the required number of units.

### **Steps of the Unitary Method**

1. **Find the value of one unit** (by division).
2. **Find the value of the required quantity** (by multiplication).

### **When to Use It?**

- Cost calculations (e.g., price per kg)
- Speed/distance/time problems
- Work and time management
- Recipe scaling

## **2. Types of Unitary Method**

There are two main types:

1. **Direct Variation** (Proportion increases together)
2. **Inverse Variation** (One increases, the other decreases)

## **3. Real-Life Applications of the Unitary Method**

| **Scenario** | **Unitary Method Application**                                          |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shopping** | If 3 shirts cost â‚¹1500, find the cost of 5 shirts.                      |
| **Cooking**  | If a recipe needs 2 cups of flour for 4 people, how much for 10 people? |
| **Speed**    | If a train covers 300 km in 5 hours, how long to cover 450 km?          |
| **Wages**    | If 8 workers earn â‚¹24,000 in a week, how much will 12 workers earn?     |

## **4. Examples of the Unitary Method**

### **Example 1: Cost Calculation (Direct Variation)**

ðŸ’¡ _Problem_: **If 5 pens cost â‚¹100, what is the cost of 8 pens?**  
**Step 1:** Find the cost of 1 pen:

$$
\text{Cost of 1 pen} = \frac{100}{5} = â‚¹20
$$

**Step 2:** Find the cost of 8 pens:

$$
\text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times 20 = â‚¹160
$$

âœ… **Answer: â‚¹160**

---

### **Example 2: Speed and Distance (Direct Variation)**

ðŸ’¡ _Problem_: **A car covers 240 km in 6 hours. How much distance will it cover in 10 hours at the same speed?**  
**Step 1:** Find the distance covered in 1 hour:

$$
\text{Distance in 1 hour} = \frac{240}{6} = 40 \text{ km}
$$

**Step 2:** Find the distance in 10 hours:

$$
40 \times 10 = 400 \text{ km}
$$

âœ… **Answer: 400 km**

---

### **Example 3: Work and Wages (Direct Variation)**

ðŸ’¡ _Problem_: **If 4 workers earn â‚¹2000 in a day, how much will 7 workers earn in a day?**  
**Step 1:** Find the earnings of 1 worker:

$$
\text{Earnings of 1 worker} = \frac{2000}{4} = â‚¹500
$$

**Step 2:** Find the earnings of 7 workers:

$$
7 \times 500 = â‚¹3500
$$

âœ… **Answer: â‚¹3500**

---

### **Example 4: Men and Work (Inverse Variation)**

ðŸ’¡ _Problem_: **If 6 men complete a task in 12 days, how many days will 9 men take?**  
This is an **inverse proportion** case (more men â†’ fewer days).  
Using the inverse proportion formula:

$$
\text{Men} \times \text{Days} = \text{Constant}
$$

$$
6 \times 12 = 9 \times x
$$

Solving for \(x\):

$$
x = \frac{6 \times 12}{9} = 8 \text{ days}
$$

âœ… **Answer: 8 days**

---

### **Example 5: Currency Conversion (Direct Variation)**

ðŸ’¡ _Problem_: **If $1 = â‚¹80, how much is $15 in rupees?**

**Step 1:** Find the value of **$1**:

$$
\text{Value of } 1\text{ USD} = â‚¹80
$$

**Step 2:** Find the value of **$15**:

$$
15 \times 80 = â‚¹1200
$$

âœ… **Answer: â‚¹1200**

---

### **Example 6: Work and Time (Inverse Variation)**

ðŸ’¡ _Problem_: **If 6 workers build a wall in 10 days, how long will 15 workers take?**

**Solution**:

**Step 1:** Find work done by 1 worker in **1 day**:

$$
6 \text{ workers} \times 10 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ worker-days}
$$

**Step 2:** Find time for **15 workers**:

$$
\frac{60 \text{ worker-days}}{15 \text{ workers}} = 4 \text{ days}
$$

âœ… **Answer**: 15 workers will take **4 days**.

## **4. Common Mistakes to Avoid**

1. **Mixing Direct & Inverse Proportion**:

   - Direct: More quantity â†’ More cost (use multiplication).
   - Inverse: More workers â†’ Less time (use division).

2. **Unit Consistency**:

   - Ensure all quantities are in the same units (e.g., convert kg to grams if needed).

3. **Incorrect Order of Operations**:
   - Always find **one unit first**, then scale up.

---

## **5. Practice Problems**

1. **Direct Proportion**:

ðŸ’¡ _Problem_: **If 12 pencils cost â‚¹60, find the cost of 20 pencils.**
**Solution**:

$$
\frac{60}{12} = â‚¹5 \text{ per pencil} \implies 20 \times 5 = â‚¹100
$$

2. **Inverse Proportion**:

ðŸ’¡ _Problem_: **If 5 pipes fill a tank in 60 minutes, how long will 3 pipes take?**

**Solution**:

$$
5 \times 60 = 300 \text{ pipe-minutes} \implies \frac{300}{3} = 100 \text{ mins}
$$

## **6. Summary**

- **Step 1**: Find the value of **one unit** (divide).
- **Step 2**: Scale up to the required quantity (multiply).
- **Direct Proportion**: Both quantities increase/decrease together.
- **Inverse Proportion**: One increases while the other decreases.

The unitary method is a **powerful tool** for solving real-world problems efficiently! ðŸš€
