# **Proportion (Direct and Inverse) â€“ Explanation with Examples**

## **1. What is Proportion?**

A **proportion** is an equation that states that two **ratios** are equal. It is used to compare relationships between two quantities. If the two ratios are equal, they form a proportion.

ðŸ“Œ **Example:**  
If 2 pens cost â‚¹10, then 4 pens should cost â‚¹20. This can be written as:

$$
\frac{2}{10} = \frac{4}{20}
$$

This is a proportion.

### **Proportion Formula**

A proportion is written as:

$$
a:b = c:d \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}
$$

ðŸ”¹ **Here,**

- **a & b** form the first ratio
- **c & d** form the second ratio
- **b & c** are called **means**
- **a & d** are called **extremes**

If the product of **means = product of extremes**, the proportion is true:

$$
b \times c = a \times d
$$

## **2. Types of Proportion**

There are **two main types** of proportion:

1. **Direct Proportion** (Direct Variation)
2. **Inverse Proportion** (Inverse Variation)

---

## **3. Direct Proportion**

Two quantities **increase or decrease together** in the same ratio.

ðŸ“Œ **Mathematical Representation:**

$$
\frac{x_1}{y_1} = \frac{x_2}{y_2}
$$

Or,

$$
x \propto y \quad \text{(x is directly proportional to y)}
$$

Or,

$$
y = kx \quad (k = \text{constant})
$$

This means when **one quantity increases, the other also increases**.

### **Example 1: Price of Apples**

- If **1 kg of apples costs â‚¹50**, then **2 kg costs â‚¹100**.
- Here, as **weight increases, cost also increases**.
- The proportion is:

$$
\frac{1}{50} = \frac{2}{100}
$$

### **Example 2: Speed and Distance**

- If a car moves at **60 km/h for 2 hours**, it covers **120 km**.
- If it moves at the same speed for **4 hours**, it covers **240 km**.
- Since distance increases with time, we write:

$$
\frac{2}{120} = \frac{4}{240}
$$

---

## **4. Inverse Proportion**

Two quantities are **inversely proportional** if **one increases while the other decreases**.

ðŸ“Œ **Mathematical Representation:**

$$
x \times y = \text{constant} \quad \text{or} \quad x_1 \times y_1 = x_2 \times y_2
$$

Or,

$$
x \propto \frac{1}{y}
$$

### **Example 1: Workers and Time**

- If **5 workers** complete a task in **10 days**,
- Then **10 workers** will complete it in **5 days**.
- Since increasing workers reduces time, we use inverse proportion:

$$
5 \times 10 = 10 \times 5
$$

### **Example 2: Speed and Time**

- A car takes **6 hours** to cover a distance at **50 km/h**.
- If the speed increases to **100 km/h**, the time reduces to **3 hours**.
- Since increasing speed decreases time, we write:

$$
50 \times 6 = 100 \times 3
$$

## **5. Difference Between Direct and Inverse Proportion**

| **Feature**     | **Direct Proportion**                          | **Inverse Proportion**                            |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**  | Both quantities increase or decrease together. | One quantity increases while the other decreases. |
| **Formula**     | $x_1/y_1 = x_2/y_2$                            | $x_1 \times y_1 = x_2 \times y_2$                 |
| **Example**     | More items â†’ More cost                         | More workers â†’ Less time                          |
| **Graph Shape** | Straight line (y = kx)                         | Curved line (y = k/x)                             |

## **6. Applications of Proportion**

### **(a) Direct Proportion**

- **Shopping:** More quantity â†’ More cost.
- **Work Efficiency:** More workers â†’ More work done.
- **Fuel Consumption:** More distance â†’ More fuel used.

### **(b) Inverse Proportion**

- **Speed vs Time:** More speed â†’ Less time to reach.
- **Men vs Work:** More workers â†’ Less time required.
- **Supply Distribution:** More demand â†’ Less supply per person.

## **7. Solving Proportion Problems**

### **Example 1 (Direct Proportion)**

A car consumes **5 liters of fuel for 50 km**. How much fuel is needed for **150 km**?  
Using direct proportion:

$$
\frac{5}{50} = \frac{x}{150}
$$

Solving:

$$
x = \frac{5 \times 150}{50} = 15
$$

âœ… **Answer: 15 liters**

### **Example 2 (Direct Proportion)**

If 5 books cost \$25, how much do 8 books cost?

$$
\frac{5}{25} = \frac{8}{y} \implies y = \$40
$$

âœ… **Answer: $ \$40 $**

---

### **Example 3 (Inverse Proportion)**

If **6 men** build a wall in **10 days**, how long will **12 men** take?  
Using inverse proportion:

$$
6 \times 10 = 12 \times x
$$

Solving:

$$
x = \frac{6 \times 10}{12} = 5
$$

âœ… **Answer: 5 days**

### **Example 4 (Inverse Proportion)**

If 4 machines finish a task in 10 hours, how long for 5 machines?

$$
4 \times 10 = 5 \times y \implies y = 8 \text{ hours}
$$

âœ… **Answer: 8 hours**

## **8. Key Differences**

## **9. Conclusion**

- **Direct Proportion:** Both values increase/decrease together.
- **Inverse Proportion:** One value increases while the other decreases.
- Used in daily life for shopping, travel, and work calculations.
