Here is a detailed explanation of **Number Systems** with proper examples:

---

## **1. Natural Numbers (N)**

- **Definition**: Natural numbers are the counting numbers starting from **1, 2, 3, 4, …**
- **Set Notation**: N = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, $\dots$}
- **Properties**:
  - The smallest natural number is **1**.
  - There is no largest natural number ( infinite set ).
  - All natural numbers are **positive**.
  - Addition and multiplication of two natural numbers always give a natural number ( Closed under + and × ).
- **Example**:
  - 5 and 8 are natural numbers.
  - 5 + 8 = 13 ( still a natural number ).
  - 5 × 8 = 40 ( still a natural number ).

---

## **2. Whole Numbers (W)**

- **Definition**: Whole numbers include all natural numbers along with **zero**.
- **Set Notation**: W = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, $\dots$}
- **Properties**:
  - The smallest whole number is **0**.
  - Whole numbers are closed under **addition** and **multiplication**.
  - Whole numbers are **not** closed under **subtraction** and **division**.
- **Example**:
  - 0, 3, and 10 are whole numbers.
  - 3 + 10 = 13 ( whole number ).
  - 10 - 3 = 7 ( whole number ).
  - 3 - 10 = -7 ( **not a whole number** ).

---

## **3. Integers (Z)**

- **Definition**: Integers include **positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero**.
- **Set Notation**: Z = { $\dots$, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, $\dots$}
- **Properties**:
  - **Closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication**.
  - **Not closed under division** ( Example: $5 \div 2 = 2.5$, which is not an integer ).
- **Example**:
  - -7, 0, and 5 are integers.
  - -7 + 5 = -2 ( integer ).
  - -7 × 5 = -35 ( integer ).
  - -7 ÷ 5 = -1.4 ( **not an integer** ).

---

## **4. Rational Numbers (Q)**

- **Definition**: A rational number is any number that can be expressed in the form **$\frac{p}{q}$** where **p** and **q** are integers, and **$q ≠ 0$**.
- **Set Notation**:

$$
\det(A) = \begin{vmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{vmatrix}
$$

$\mathbb{Q} = \left\{ \frac{p}{q} \mid p, q \in \mathbb{Z}, q \neq 0 \right\}$

- **Properties**:
  - Rational numbers include integers, fractions, and terminating/repeating decimals.
  - Rational numbers are **closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division** ( except division by zero ).
- **Example**:
  - $\frac{3}{4}$, $-\frac{7}{2}$, and 5 since $5 = \frac{5}{1}$.
  - $\frac{3}{4}$+ $\frac{1}{2}$= $\frac{3}{4}$+ $\frac{2}{4}$= $\frac{5}{4}$( rational ).
  - 0.75 is rational because it can be written as $\frac{3}{4}$.
  - **Repeating Decimal**: $0.\overline{3}$= $\frac{1}{3}$( rational ).

---

## **5. Irrational Numbers (I)**

- **Definition**: An irrational number is a number that **cannot** be written in the form **$\frac{p}{q} $**.
- **Properties**:
  - The decimal expansion of an irrational number is **non-terminating and non-repeating**.
  - The sum or product of a rational and an irrational number is irrational (except in special cases).
- **Common Irrational Numbers**:
  - $\pi = 3.1415926535... $( never repeats, never ends ).
  - $\sqrt{2} = 1.414213... $( cannot be written as a fraction ).
  - $e = 2.718281828... $( Euler’s number ).
- **Example**:
  - $\sqrt{3} + 2$ is irrational.
  - $\pi - 5$ is irrational.
  - $0.101001000100001000001... $ is irrational ( no repeating pattern ).

---

## **6. Real Numbers (R)**

- **Definition**: The set of **all rational and irrational numbers**.
- **Set Notation**: $R = Q \cup I$
- **Properties**:
  - Includes **natural numbers, whole numbers, integers, rational numbers, and irrational numbers**.
  - Real numbers can be represented on a number line.
- **Example**:
  - 2, -7, $\frac{3}{4}$, $\sqrt{5}$, and $\pi$are all real numbers.

---

## **7. Complex Numbers (C)**

- **Definition**: Complex numbers include real and imaginary numbers in the form **$a + bi$**, where **$i = \sqrt{-1} $**.
- **Set Notation**: $C = \{  a + bi \mid a, b \in R$, $i = \sqrt{-1}  \}$
- **Properties**:
  - If **b** = **0** , then **a** + **0i** = **a** ( real number ).
  - If **a** = **0**, then **0** + **bi** = **bi** ( pure imaginary number ).
- **Example**:
  - **3** + **4i** is a complex number.
  - $i^2 = -1$.
  - $(2 + 3i)$+ $(4 - i)$= $6 + 2i$.

---

## **8. Prime and Composite Numbers**

### **Prime Numbers**

- **Definition**: A prime number is a natural number **greater than 1** that has exactly **two factors**: **1 and itself**.
- **Examples**:

  - 2 (factors: 1, 2)
  - 3 (factors: 1, 3)
  - 5 (factors: 1, 5)
  - 7 (factors: 1, 7)
  - 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, … ( infinitely many )

- **Important Points**:
  - **2 is the only even prime number**.
  - **1 is NOT a prime number** because it has only one factor ( 1 itself ).
  - All prime numbers are **odd except 2**.
  - Prime numbers are useful in cryptography, number theory, and various algorithms.

**Example**:

- Check if **29** is prime:
  - Factors of 29: **1, 29**
  - Since it has only two factors, **29 is a prime number**.

---

### **Composite Numbers**

- **Definition**: A composite number is a natural number greater than **1** that has **more than two factors**.
- **Examples**:

  - 4 (factors: 1, 2, 4)
  - 6 (factors: 1, 2, 3, 6)
  - 9 (factors: 1, 3, 9)
  - 12 (factors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12)

- **Important Points**:
  - The smallest composite number is **4** ( because 2 and 3 are prime ).
  - Every composite number can be **expressed as the product of prime numbers** ( Prime Factorization ).

**Example**:

- Is **15** composite?
  - Factors of 15: **1, 3, 5, 15** (more than two factors).
  - So, **15 is a composite number**.

## **9. Even and Odd Numbers**

### **Even Numbers**

- **Definition**: A number is even if it is **divisible by 2**.
- **Mathematical Form**: **2n** ( where **n** is an integer ).
- **Examples**:
  - 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, …
- **Properties**:
  - The sum of two even numbers is **even**.
    - 4 + 6 = 10 ( even )
  - The product of two even numbers is **even**.
    - $4 \times 6$= 24 ( even )
  - Even numbers always end in **0, 2, 4, 6, or 8**.

**Example**:

- Check if **48** is even:
  - Last digit = 8 ( divisible by 2 ).
  - So, **48 is an even number**.

---

### **Odd Numbers**

- **Definition**: A number is odd if it is **not divisible by 2**.
- **Mathematical Form**: **2n** + **1** ( where **n** is an integer ).
- **Examples**:
  - 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, …
- **Properties**:
  - The sum of two odd numbers is **even**.
    - 3 + 5 = 8 ( even )
  - The product of two odd numbers is **odd**.
    - $3 \times 5$= 15 ( odd )
  - Odd numbers always end in **1, 3, 5, 7, or 9**.

**Example**:

- Check if **35** is odd:
  - Last digit = 5 ( **not** divisible by 2 ).
  - So, **35 is an odd number**.

---

## **10. Consecutive Numbers**

- **Definition**: Consecutive numbers are **numbers that follow each other in order** without skipping any number.
- **Types**:

  1. **Consecutive Natural Numbers**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, …
  2. **Consecutive Even Numbers**: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, …
  3. **Consecutive Odd Numbers**: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, …

- **Properties**:
  - The difference between any two consecutive numbers is **1**.
  - The difference between two consecutive even or odd numbers is **2**.

**Example**:

1. Find three consecutive numbers after **8**:
   - 9, 10, 11.
2. Find three consecutive even numbers after **12**:
   - 14, 16, 18.
