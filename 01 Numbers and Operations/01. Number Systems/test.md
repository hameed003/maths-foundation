## **4. Rational Numbers (Q)**

- **Definition**: A rational number is any number that can be expressed in the form **$\frac{p}{q}$** where **p** and **q** are integers, and **q â‰  0**.
- **Set Notation**: $Q = \left\{\frac{p}{q} \mid p, q \in Z, q \neq 0 \right\}$
- **Properties**:
  - Rational numbers include integers, fractions, and terminating/repeating decimals.
  - Rational numbers are **closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division** (except division by zero).
- **Example**:
  - $\frac{3}{4}$, $-\frac{7}{2}$, and 5 (since $5 = \frac{5}{1}$).
  - $\frac{3}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{5}{4}$ (rational).
  - 0.75 is rational because it can be written as $\frac{3}{4}$.
  - **Repeating Decimal**: $0.\overline{3} = \frac{1}{3}$ (rational).
