## **3. Integers (Z)**

- **Definition**: Integers include **positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero**.
- **Set Notation**: $Z = \{\dots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots\}$
- **Properties**:
  - **Closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication**.
  - **Not closed under division** (Example: $5 \div 2 = 2.5$, which is not an integer).
- **Example**:
  - -7, 0, and 5 are integers.
  - -7 + 5 = -2 (integer).
  - -7 × 5 = -35 (integer).
  - -7 ÷ 5 = -1.4 (**not an integer**).

## **4. Rational Numbers (Q)**

- **Definition**: A rational number is any number that can be expressed in the form **$\frac{p}{q}$** where **p** and **q** are integers, and **q ≠ 0**.
- **Set Notation**: $Q = \left\{\frac{p}{q} \mid p, q \in Z, q \neq 0 \right\}$
- **Properties**:
  - Rational numbers include integers, fractions, and terminating/repeating decimals.
  - Rational numbers are **closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division** (except division by zero).
- **Example**:
  - $\frac{3}{4}$, $-\frac{7}{2}$, and 5 (since $5 = \frac{5}{1}$).
  - $\frac{3}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{5}{4}$ (rational).
  - 0.75 is rational because it can be written as $\frac{3}{4}$.
  - **Repeating Decimal**: $0.\overline{3} = \frac{1}{3}$ (rational).

## **5. Irrational Numbers (I)**

- **Definition**: An irrational number is a number that **cannot** be written in the form **$\frac{p}{q}$**.
- **Properties**:
  - The decimal expansion of an irrational number is **non-terminating and non-repeating**.
  - The sum or product of a rational and an irrational number is irrational (except in special cases).
- **Common Irrational Numbers**:
  - $\pi = 3.1415926535...$ (never repeats, never ends).
  - $\sqrt{2} = 1.414213...$ (cannot be written as a fraction).
  - $e = 2.718281828...$ (Euler’s number).
- **Example**:
  - $\sqrt{3} + 2$ is irrational.
  - $\pi - 5$ is irrational.
  - $0.101001000100001000001...$ is irrational (no repeating pattern).
