Yes, that's **true**!

An **irrational number** **cannot** be written as a **fraction** (i.e., in the form `a/b` where `a` and `b` are integers and `b ≠ 0`).

### Example:

- `√2`, `π`, and `e` are **irrational**.
- You can’t express them exactly as a ratio of two integers.

Let me know if you want examples or a simple trick to identify them!
